# JWT Scala 0.18.0

Scala support for JSON Web Token ([JWT](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token)). Supports Java 1.6+, Scala 2.11.x and Scala 2.12.x. Optional helpers for Play Framework, Play JSON, Json4s Native, Json4s Jackson, Circe and uPickle.

## Pick the right tool for the right job

JWT Scala is divided in several sub-projects each targeting a specific use-case. Depending on your need, you want to pick the right one.

If you need a previous version of the Scaladoc API, check [the bottom of this page](https://pauldijou.github.io/jwt-scala/api/#old-apis)

You can also check a [standalone Play application](https://github.com/pauldijou/jwt-scala/tree/master/examples/play-angular-standalone) using `jwt-play` and implementating a small REST API with authentication and admin role (include a UI too!).

## Install

In the following snippet, replace `[name]` with the actual name of the project you need. **Using Java 1.6 or 1.7?** Add `-legacy` after the name of the project. See [below](#which-java) why.

**build.sbt**

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.pauldijou" %% "[name]" % "0.18.0"
)
```

### Example for `jwt-play` using Java 1.6

**build.sbt**

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.pauldijou" %% "jwt-play-legacy" % "0.18.0"
)
```

## Dependencies

- `"org.bouncycastle" % "bcpkix-jdk15on"`
- `"commons-codec" % "commons-codec"` (only if Java 1.6 or 1.7)

## Algorithms

If you are using `String` key, please keep in mind that such keys need to be parsed. Rather than implementing a super complex parser, the one in JWT Scala is pretty simple and might not work for all use-cases (especially for ECDSA keys). In such case, consider using `SecretKey` or `PrivateKey` or `PublicKey` directly. It is way better for you. All API support all those types.

Check [ECDSA samples](https://pauldijou.github.io/jwt-scala/samples/jwt-ecdsa) for more infos.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|HMD5|HMAC using MD5 algorithm|
|HS224|HMAC using SHA-224 algorithm|
|HS256|HMAC using SHA-256 algorithm|
|HS384|HMAC using SHA-384 algorithm|
|HS512|HMAC using SHA-512 algorithm|
|RS256|RSASSA using SHA-256 algorithm|
|RS384|RSASSA using SHA-384 algorithm|
|RS512|RSASSA using SHA-512 algorithm|
|ES256|ECDSA using SHA-256 algorithm|
|ES384|ECDSA using SHA-384 algorithm|
|ES512|ECDSA using SHA-512 algorithm|

## <a name="which-java"></a>Which Java?

Actually, all sub-projects have two flavours. One target Java 1.8+, using the new Time API and the new Base64 util. This is the default one. If you are using Java 1.6 or 1.7 (which have both reached end-of-life by the way), you will have to use the "legacy" version of the lib. It's exactly the same (in fact, 99% of the code source is shared) except it's using the old Calendar API and the Base64 util from Apache Commons Codec (introducing **one small dependency** in this particular use-case).

## Security concerns

This lib doesn't want to impose anything, that's why, by default, a JWT claim is totally empty. That said, you should always add an `issuedAt` attribute to it, probably using `claim.issuedNow`. The reason is that even HTTPS isn't perfect and having always the same chunk of data transfered can be of a big help to crack it. Generating a slightly different token at each request is way better even if it adds a bit of payload to the response. If you are using a session timeout through the `expiration` attribute which is extended at each request, that's fine too. I can't find the article I read about that vulnerability but if someone has some resources about the topic, I would be glad to link them.

## Got a problem?

If you found any bug or need more documentation, immediately feel an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/pauldijou/jwt-scala/issues). I should read most of them.

If you want to submit a PR to improve the project, that would be awesome. If, in top of that, you want to run the tests (yeah, because there are tests! A few of them...) before submitting it, you are just amasing but also don't run the tests globally. If you do `sbt test`, the whole universe will nearly collapse due to classpath errors that are totally beyond the understanding of the current me. Run them by project, like `playEdge/test` inside an `sbt` console. And even so, they might fail because of a `LinkageError`, just run them twice and it will work... I don't know why... I drank too much whisky trying to understand it so I just stopped. If you are a classpath God, just ping me and I will have questions for you.

## Notes

- **Test**: run all tests with `sbt testAll` (if `java.lang.LinkageError`, just re-run the command)
- **Publish**: update version numbers in `build.sbt` and run `sbt release` (be sure to either `reload` inside sbt or start a new sbt)
- **Scaladoc**: to manually generate all scaladoc, run `sbt scaladoc`
- **Publish docs**: to manually build and push online the doc website, run `sbt publish-doc`
- **Docs**: to have a locally running doc website:
  - `sbt ~docs/makeSite`
  - `cd docs/target/site`
  - `jekyll serve`
  - Go to [http://localhost:4000/jwt-scala/](http://localhost:4000/jwt-scala/)
