# JWT Scala

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jwt-scala/jwt-scala/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=q5p4MAH3YS)](https://codecov.io/gh/jwt-scala/jwt-scala)

Scala support for JSON Web Token ([JWT](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token)).
Supports Java 8+ and Scala 2.12/2.13/3.0.
Dependency free.
Optional helpers for Play Framework, Play JSON, Json4s Native, Json4s Jackson, Circe, uPickle, Spray JSON and Argonaut.

## Usage

Detailed documentation is on the [Microsite](https://jwt-scala.github.io/jwt-scala).

JWT Scala is divided in several sub-projects each targeting a specific JSON library,
check the doc from the menu of the Microsite for installation and usage instructions.

## Algorithms

If you are using `String` key, please keep in mind that such keys need to be parsed. Rather than implementing a super complex parser, the one in JWT Scala is pretty simple and might not work for all use-cases (especially for ECDSA keys). In such case, consider using `SecretKey` or `PrivateKey` or `PublicKey` directly. It is way better for you. All API support all those types.

Check [ECDSA samples](https://jwt-scala.github.io/jwt-scala/jwt-core-jwt-ecdsa.html) for more infos.

## Security concerns

This lib doesn't want to impose anything, that's why, by default, a JWT claim is totally empty. That said, you should always add an `issuedAt` attribute to it, probably using `claim.issuedNow`.
The reason is that even HTTPS isn't perfect and having always the same chunk of data transfered can be of a big help to crack it. Generating a slightly different token at each request is way better even if it adds a bit of payload to the response.
If you are using a session timeout through the `expiration` attribute which is extended at each request, that's fine too. I can't find the article I read about that vulnerability but if someone has some resources about the topic, I would be glad to link them.
